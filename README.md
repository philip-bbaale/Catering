Project setup instructions: Your friend has a catering company and needs a website to get some more business. Design a website using Bootstrap. Pay attention to how the page is responsive right out of the box.
Use a container to house the page content.
Include a jumbotron to display the company's name and slogan.
Use panels to hold the meals offered by the company.
Use helper classes to highlight and emphasize various parts of the page.
Bonus: see the notes on Bootstrap blockquotes (Links to an external site.) and see if you can figure out how to add some to the page to display customer testimonials.
